<p>According to the reports animals' caretaker discovered an empty panda yard on july 4th at 5 am NYC time. The only evidence left turned out to be a map of New York city and an old newspaper dated year 2005 with the picture of a legend - Marty the zebra. Police believes that one poacher who have recently been arrested for grand theft and escaped - has something to do with dissappearance of the cute vulnerable creature. But unusually a lot of old people that has been living here for more than 3 decades say one same thing - "Check the penguins"</p>
